<p>Solheim, land of the Dawn, the Shining Dynasty, once led by Emperor Durn of the Sun, Herald of the Morninglord, is at war. Emperor Durn is dead, and 7 of his sons rage for the Kingdom.</p>
<p>But that matters little to you. Thousands of miles of sea lie between you and the old lands. Generations have passed since your ancestors traversed the White Sea and created new lives in the Land of the High Hills. This is the only place you call home, and you are to be a Steward of the Dawn.</p>
<p>The High Hills are a wild land, split up into five know regions; The Golden Coast, Lakenlan, The Peaks, The Giantswood, and Highcrest on the Sea. Much remains unexplored beyond the Peaks and the Giantswood but the Stewards of Dawn continue to push out into the wilds establishing new holds, exploring new lands, discovering ancient secrets and new peoples.</p>
<p>There are only two ways to get into the Stewards of the Dawn, as a volunteer or as a prisoner. Prisoners are sent to the Farfort to serve as Keepers of the Hold. A fancy title for a servant; they cook, clean, and manage the stables. It is not uncommon that a hard-working and talented Keeper will break rank and be invited to join the ranks of the Stewards.</p>
<p>Volunteers start out as Stewards in Training, learning the ways of their trade and going out on missions in small groups as designated by the Master of the Hold. Eventually, they will be made into true Stewards and will lead teams of their own exploring new lands and establishing new holds across the regions.</p>
