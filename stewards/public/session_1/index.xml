      <description>You rub the sleep from your eyes, it still must be late because it’s dark outside. Unsure of what woke you, you turn over and look around your small room. Everything appears normal except you notice a faint orange light flickering in from underneath your door. You catch a scent of smoke, but before you can register it, you hear a horrifying noise from the yard. The panicked squealing of pigs makes your heart pound.</description>

      <description>You awake in a small bed in a room you don’t recognize. It smells like someone is roasting something, and there is a bustle of noise come from the other side of the door.
You enter a hallway, it looks like you are in an inn of some sort. The walls are painted bright yellow, and there are several wooden doors along the hallway, each with a large number painted in yellow in the center.</description>
