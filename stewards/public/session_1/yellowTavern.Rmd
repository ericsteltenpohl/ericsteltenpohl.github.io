You awake in a small bed in a room you donâ€™t recognize. It smells like someone is roasting something, and there is a bustle of noise come from the other side of the door.

You enter a hallway, it looks like you are in an inn of some sort. The walls are painted bright yellow, and there are several wooden doors along the hallway, each with a large number painted in yellow in the center. Conversations and laughter filter down the hall.
