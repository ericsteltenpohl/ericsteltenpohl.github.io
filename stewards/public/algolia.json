Emperor Durn is dead, and 7 of his sons rage for the Kingdom.\nBut that matters little to you. Thousands of miles of sea lie between you and the old lands. Generations have passed since your ancestors traversed the White Sea and created new lives in the Land of the High Hills. This is the only place you call home, and you are to be a Steward of the Dawn.\nThe High Hills are a wild land, split up into five know regions; The Golden Coast, Lakenlan, The Peaks, The Giantswood, and Highcrest on the Sea. Much remains unexplored beyond the Peaks and the Giantswood but the Stewards of Dawn continue to push out into the wilds establishing new holds, exploring new lands, discovering ancient secrets and new peoples.\nThere are only two ways to get into the Stewards of the Dawn, as a volunteer or as a prisoner. Prisoners are sent to the Farfort to serve as Keepers of the Hold. A fancy title for a servant; they cook, clean, and manage the stables. It is not uncommon that a hard-working and talented Keeper will break rank and be invited to join the ranks of the Stewards.\nVolunteers start out as Stewards in Training, learning the ways of their trade and going out on missions in small groups as designated by the Master of the Hold. Eventually, they will be made into true Stewards and will lead teams of their own exploring new lands and establishing new holds across the regions.\n","date":1397001600,"description":"","lastmod":"2014-04-09T00:00:00Z","objectID":"6083a88ee3411b0d17ce02d738f69d47","permalink":"https://example.com/about/","publishdate":"2014-04-09T00:00:00Z","title":"About Stewards"},{"content":" Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

Unsure of what woke you, you turn over and look around your small room. Everything appears normal except you notice a faint orange light flickering in from underneath your door. You catch a scent of smoke, but before you can register it, you hear a horrifying noise from the yard. The panicked squealing of pigs makes your heart pound.\nAs you step outside, the scene before you is difficult to comprehend. Your humble barn is ablaze, flames ripping through the thatched roof, anything once living in there would certainly be dead, but there are no pigs in sight, and you no longer hear their squeals. In fact, things have gone eerily quiet since you stepped out into the dark.\nAs your eyes adjust to the flames, you notice a shadowy humanoid figure just beyond the edge of your pasture. The light from the blaze seems to disappear into this shade, it is completely black, and you can’t make out any of its features.\nYou feel heat emanating from above and behind you. The last thing you hear is a loud crack before the world around you goes dark.\n","date":1508253975,"description":"","lastmod":"2017-10-17T15:26:15Z","objectID":"769d7c2c8aae8b973d54a970f9acf8b7","permalink":"https://example.com/session_1/thefarm/","publishdate":"2017-10-17T15:26:15Z","title":"The Farm"},{"content":" You awake in a small bed in a room you don’t recognize. It smells like someone is roasting something, and there is a bustle of noise come from the other side of the door.\nYou enter a hallway, it looks like you are in an inn of some sort. The walls are painted bright yellow, and there are several wooden doors along the hallway, each with a large number painted in yellow in the center. Conversations and laughter filter down the hall.\n","date":1508253975,"description":"","lastmod":"2017-10-17T15:26:15Z","objectID":"db1f86f81e4395302e412f4e9b814a72","permalink":"https://example.com/session_1/yellowtavern/","publishdate":"2017-10-17T15:26:15Z","title":"The Yellow Tavern"}]
